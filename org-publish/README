* org-mode to wordpress
** Problem description
export org-mode to html files: for each top entries of org-mode file generate one separate html
** Feature
- Each org-mode file may be huge, thus we want to generate a separate html file for each top org-mode entries.
- We need to generate a index html for each org-mode, which serves as a sitemap for related html files.
** Design
*** leverage org-publish by one customized publishing-function
**** Step1: manage your org-mode: tag entries as :BLOG:, if you want to exported them
**** Step2: customize org-publish
- put below elisp codes to your .emacs configuration
- Customize org-publish-project-alist variable to change :base-directory and :publishing-directory
**** [Optional] Step3: Don't export entries of "TODO", "CANCELED", etc
Put into your org-mode, please make sure your org-version is later than 7.5:
